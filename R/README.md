# GenAI workshop using R

## Environment setup

### Install R if required
If you do not already have R (or RStudio) installed, you can use the pixi pacakge manager to do so via the `pixi.toml` file here.

### Install R pacakges via renv
Install the required depencies via renv (install renv first!). Here is a reference for renv: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

### Grab your `API_KEY`, `VIRTUAL_KEY` and define the `LLM_MODEL`
You can get these from the Portkey UI at `app.portkey.ai`. Set these as environment variables and run the scripts.
