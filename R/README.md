# GenAI workshop using R

## Environment setup

### Install R if required
If you do not already have R (or `RStudio`) installed, you can use the `pixi` pacakge manager to do so via the `pixi.toml` file here.

### Install R pacakges via `renv`
Install the required depencies via `renv` (install `renv` first!). Here is a reference for `renv`: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

### Grab your `PORTKEY_API_KEY` and define the `LLM_MODEL`
You can get your user API Portkey UI at `app.portkey.ai` and a model from the `ModelCatalog`. Set these as environment variables and run the scripts.
